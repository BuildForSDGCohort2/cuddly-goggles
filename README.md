# cuddly-goggles
cuddly-goggles is an open source industrial photography site to help science researchers, interviewees and other people who could need any information. the name cuddly-goggles was suggested by github and I licked it, we can always change it later though. 

## Industrial photography is common in various industries, including construction, mining, manufacturing, energy and transportation. Often, industrial photographs show people building and making things â€“ the aim is to capture the manufacturing process and the laborious jobs that are performed by workers.

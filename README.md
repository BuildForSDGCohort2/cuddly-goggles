## cuddly-goggles
cuddly-goggles is an open source industrial photography site to help science researchers, interviewees and other people who could need any information. the name cuddly-goggles was suggested by github and I licked it, we can always change it later though. 

 Industrial photography is common in various industries, including construction, mining, manufacturing, energy and transportation. Often, industrial photographs show people building and making things â€“ the aim is to capture the manufacturing process and the laborious jobs that are performed by workers.
